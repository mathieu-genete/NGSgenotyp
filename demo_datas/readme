Datas format:

      sample DRS032518: concatenated reads data; need to use the split option - paired end datas => format=paired,split=True
      sample DRS032528: paired end datas => format=paired
      sample DRS032540: concatenated reads data; need to use the split option - paired end datas => format=paired,split=True

Expected genotype for all three samples

	 sample DRS032518: AhSRK12 and AhSRK01
	 sample DRS032528: AhSRK01
	 sample DRS032540: AhSRK02 and AhSRK19


format for the reads list file (by default format=single and split=False):
       
       /path/to/the/fastq/folder
       sample_name_1,fastq_file_1, fastq_file_2,...
       sample_name_2,fastq_Fwd_1,fastq_Rev_1,...,fastq_Fwd_n,fastq_Rev_n,format=paired,split=False
       sample_name_2,fastq_concatenated_1,...,format=paired,split=True
       .
       .
       .

You can add a comment, only after the first line. The first line must always contain the absolute path to the fastq files folder.

add "format=paired" when you have paired datas for a sample.
If you have concatenated datas, use the 'split' option by adding "split=True"
