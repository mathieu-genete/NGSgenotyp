Datas format:

      sample DRS032518: interlaces data - use the split option
      sample DRS032528: paired end datas - if split option is set, add ,format=paired,nosplit=True to the reads list file (see below)
      sample DRS032540: interlaces data - use the split option

Expected genotype for all three samples

	 sample DRS032518: AhSRK12 and AhSRK01
	 sample DRS032528: AhSRK01
	 sample DRS032540: AhSRK02 and AhSRK19


format for the reads list file:
       /path/to/the/fastq/folder
       sample_name_1,fastq_file_1, fastq_file_2,...
       sample_name_2,fastq_Fwd_1,fastq_Rev_1,...,fastq_Fwd_n,fastq_Rev_n,format=paired,nosplit=True
       .
       .
       .

You can add a comment, only after the first line. The first line must always contain the absolute path to the fastq files folder.

add "format=paried" when you have paired datas for a sample.
to prevent files from being split add "nosplit=True"
When you have paired datas, you should use both parameters at the same time: ....,format=paired,nosplit=True
